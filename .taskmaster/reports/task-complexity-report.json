			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the need to deeply integrate Material You (Material 3) principles, including dynamic color theming, adaptive typography, elevation, and motion transitions, all of which require careful design and technical implementation[2][3][4]. The navigation must be fully responsive, accessible, and support conditional rendering based on authentication state, as well as integrate with notifications and be reusable across the app. Material You's dynamic color system and accessibility requirements add significant development and testing overhead[2][4]. The breadth of requirements and integration points justifies a high complexity score and the need for at least eight focused subtasks."
